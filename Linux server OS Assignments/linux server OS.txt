 - create symbolink and hard link for skillset file 
 - delete skillset file and check if hardlink and symbolic link file exists
 - explain the difference b/n symbolic and hard links
	mkdir test2
	ln -s skillset slink
	ln skillset hlink

	cat >>file1
	
5. Revoke write permission from user2 group and test the access again
	chmod 744 file1
	cat >>file1 
6. Grant write permission for others and test it 
	chmod 746 file1
	cat >>file1
7. Revoke write permission for others and test again
	chmod 744 file1
	cat >>file1
8. Change the group of employeelist file to 'user3'
 test if user3 group have access
	sudo chgrp user3 employeelist
9. Change ownership of the file to user5 and test
	sudo chown user5 employeelist
	ls -l
10. check how many employees are there (hint: use wc command)
	wc -w employeelist

• Append 2 more lines to the same file
	cat >>File1
	4
	5
• Create File2 with few lines
	cat >File2

	aa
	aaa
• Display the contents of both File1 and File2 
	cat File1

  (or use)cat File1 File2
• Concatenate both File1 & 2
	cat File1 File2 >File3 
• Send the above output to File3
	cat File1 File2 >File3 
• Read File1,File2,File3… File5 . Observe the output
	cat File1 File2 File3 File4 File5
• Redirect the errors of the above command to “errorlog”
	cat File1 File2 File3 File4 File5 2>errorlog
• Concatenate name File1 to 5 and store it in File 10. if any 
errors, log them in the same file 
	cat File1 File2 File3 File4 File5 >File10 2>&1
• Copy File1 to File6. Add the errors to “errorlog”
	cp File1 File6 2>errorlog
